## Retrospective 1

a) Are you able to keep up with the requirements? Is there any iteration that you considered a big challenge? 

- - Yes, I'm keeping up the requirements, until now I completed all the requirements. Each iteration has a specific element that is a bit hard, but the biggest challenge was the iteration 3, specially because I had to change parts of my code, and to solve problems too. But I've got to finish all the requirements and my code is working perfectly. 

b) Did you test it all? Are you satisfied with the result? 

- - Yes, I did. I've tested all the parts of my code and each part is working perfectly and the way as I thought. I'm so proud of me, I did a good job. I'm so willing because I organized my code and my classes in a way that I've never done before, I can see a great personal evolution, in the past probably I'd take a few times more to solve all of this exercises. Furthermore, my logical thinking increased a lot, and I confess that I prefer the front-end development, although I also like to solve back-end problems like these.    


## Retrospective 2

a) Which problems did you find during the process? 

- - During the process I didn't find a lot of problems, the hardest part was the changes in each iteration, specially the iteration 3 because I had to fix some specific problems in the methods. Even though each iteration demanding a new implementation and a new feature in the classes, I've got to solve these iterations easily and without difficulties. 


b) Why did you learn? 

- - The most important knowledge I've got in this activity undoubtedly was the use of Inheritance between classes. I confess that it wasn't one of my strengths, however doing this activity helped me to get a new mindset and a new way of thinking about how to solve these iterations, and of course, a great knowledge about how to use inheritance between classes and how to apply the logical concepts to solve this kind of issues. I'm so proud of my final result.
